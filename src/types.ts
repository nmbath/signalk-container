   *   - `signalkConfigRootMount` resolves to `app.config.configPath`,

   * current container's mounts and finds the bind/volume that backs
   * `app.config.configPath`, falling back to the path itself when
   * SignalK runs bare-metal.
   *
   * `app.config` is provided by the SignalK server runtime; if the
   * caller's `app` object lacks `config.configPath`, an error is thrown.
   *
   * Example (a backup plugin):
